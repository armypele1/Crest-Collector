<h1>Crest Collector</h1>
This project showcases a Mario-64-esque platformer with a first-person shooter twist. 
The aim here was to demonstrate my ability to create all aspects of a complete video game, including menus, HUD, game physics and accessibility features.


To play the game, open the Playable build folder and execute "Game Dev Summative.exe".

To look at the source code and all assets, see the "Code" folder.
Use Unity version 2021.2.7f when working with this folder.

Any external asset files used are accompanied by a readme crediting the original creator
within their appropriate folders.
